# HWEBayesForensic

## What is HWEBayesForensic ?

HWEBayesForensic is a script for the Bayesian approach evaluating the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in highly polymorphic population data of multi-allelic makers.

The evaluation can be carried out in two ways: 
- parameter estimation 
- model comparison

In parameter estimation, the degree of deviation from the HWE is aggregated into a single parameter (*f*) and its value is estimated.
The model comparison uses a Bayes factor to indicate whether the data fit better in a model with or without *f*. 

This script is written in R language.
